This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Web.

* [/shared](./shared/src) is for the code that will be shared between all targets in the project.
  The most important subfolder is [commonMain](./shared/src/commonMain/kotlin). If preferred, you
  can add code to the platform-specific folders here too.

* [/webApp](./webApp) contains web React application. It uses the Kotlin/JS library produced
  by the [shared](./shared) module .
